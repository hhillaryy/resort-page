    <h1> Making travel arrangements</h1>

    <h3> Because the island is very remote you will need to fly into Main Airport and take a boat shuttle to the resort.
  Shuttles can be arranged by calling 505/200-0002.</h3>

    <h3> To get around the island it is easiest to hire a pedicab but we also have bicycles and scooters available for rent.
    Rates vary by season and demand so ask the concierge for current rates upon arrival
  </h3>
